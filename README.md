üìå Title
Integrated Retail Analytics for Store Optimization and Demand Forecasting

üìå Objective
This project aims to optimize retail store performance by leveraging data-driven insights and machine learning techniques. It focuses on forecasting sales, identifying sales anomalies, analyzing customer segments, and developing personalized marketing and inventory management strategies for enhanced customer experience and operational efficiency.

üìå Key Components
1Ô∏è‚É£ Anomaly Detection in Sales Data
Identify unusual sales patterns across stores and departments, investigate potential causes (holidays, markdowns, economic factors), and implement anomaly-handling techniques to ensure clean, reliable data for analysis.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Time-Based Anomaly Detection
Analyze sales trends over time to detect seasonal variations and holiday effects, using time-series models for understanding store and department performance dynamics.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
Handle missing values (especially in markdown data), create new features (e.g., store size/type, regional factors), and prepare the data for modeling.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Customer Segmentation Analysis
Segment stores and departments based on sales patterns, markdowns, and regional features to uncover trends and tailor strategies for different segments.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Market Basket Analysis (Proxy)
Infer product associations at the department level using sales data and suggest cross-selling strategies despite the absence of individual transaction-level data.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Demand Forecasting
Build models to predict weekly sales for each store and department, incorporating external factors such as CPI, fuel prices, and unemployment rates, with both short-term and long-term forecasting capabilities.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Impact of External Factors
Analyze how economic indicators and regional climate influence sales, integrating these insights into forecasting and strategy models.

8Ô∏è‚É£ Personalization Strategies
Propose personalized marketing strategies and inventory management approaches tailored to specific store and department segments, focusing on markdowns and customer behavior.

9Ô∏è‚É£ Segmentation Quality Evaluation
Assess the effectiveness of the customer segmentation using metrics like silhouette score, evaluating the homogeneity and separation of clusters.

10Ô∏è‚É£ Real-World Strategy Formulation
Develop actionable business strategies for inventory management, marketing, and store optimization, addressing potential real-world challenges in implementation.
